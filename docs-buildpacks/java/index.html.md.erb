## Buildpack Logging and Application Logging ##

The buildpack only runs during the staging process, and therefore only logs
staging information such as the downloaded components, configuration data, and work performed on your application by the buildpack.

The Java buildpack source documentation states the following:

* The Java buildpack logs all messages, regardless of severity, to
`APP-DIRECTORY/.java-buildpack.log`. The buildpack also logs messages to `$stderr`, filtered by a configured severity level.

* If the buildpack fails with an exception, the exception message is logged with
a log level of `ERROR`. The exception stack trace is logged with a log
level of `DEBUG`. This prevents users from seeing stack traces by default.

Once staging completes, the buildpack stops logging. The Loggregator handles application logging. 

Your application must write to STDOUT or STDERR for its logs to be included in
the Loggregator stream. For more information, see the [Application Logging in Cloud Foundry](../../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html) topic.
