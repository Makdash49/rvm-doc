## <a id='cf-app-utils'></a>Overview of RVM##

RVM is a command-line tool for installing and managing Ruby versions and their gems. It was created by Wayne E. Sequin. RVM stands for Ruby Version Manager.

RVM is very helpful when you need to change the version of Ruby you are working with.

It is also helpful whenâ€¦

This is the official website for RVM: https://rvm.io/


## <a id='vcap-services-defines-database-url'></a>Checking Your RVM ##

Check to see if RVM is installed by typing this command in your terminal: `rvm -v`

If RVM is installed you will see a message that shows the version number.

<pre class="terminal">
  $ rvm -v
  rvm 1.27.0 (latest) by Wayne E. Seguin <wayneeseguin@gmail.com>, Michal Papis <mpapis@gmail.com> [https://rvm.io/]
</pre>

If the reply has the word (latest) in parenthesis then you know you have the latest version.  Otherwise download the latest version following the steps in the next section.


You can see pertinent information about RVM with this command: `rvm info`


<pre class="terminal">
  $ rvm info

## <a id='rails-applications-have-autoconfigured-database-yml'></a>Installing RVM ##

Install RVM by typing this command in your terminal:
`\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`

Close your terminal and reopen it.  
Check to see if RVM loaded correctly by typing this command:
`rvm | head -n 1`

This should return: `= rvm` 

You can also check to see if RVM loaded correctly with this command:
`type rvm | head -1`

This should return: `rvm is a function`

If RVM did not load correctly you may see a message that directs you to make changes to your `~/.bash_profile` or your `~/.bashrc file`.

For instance, you may need to change your export PATHS so they have `$PATH` at the beginnings of the strings rather than at the ends so that they look like this:



<pre class="terminal">
  export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/heroku/bin"

  export PATH="$PATH:/Users/markmcquillen/bin"
</pre>


You may also need to add this line to your `~/.bash_profile` if is not added automatically:

<pre class="terminal">
  [[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*
</pre>


Once you have made these change, close the Terminal and open a new Terminal window.


Install the latest version of Ruby and set it as default with this command:
`rvm use ruby --install --default`

Check the Ruby version with:
`ruby -v`

You can install any version of Ruby with: `rvm install VERSION`

For instance: `rvm install 1.9.2`

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: You can check the path of RVM after installation with this
  command: <code>env | egrep -v '^PATH' | egrep '^rvm_path'</code></p>

## <a id='change-ruby-versions'></a>Changing Ruby Versions ##

See what versions of Ruby you have installed with `rvm list`

<pre class="terminal">
  $ rvm list

  rvm rubies

     ruby-2.1.2 [ x86_64 ]
     ruby-2.1.6 [ x86_64 ]
  =* ruby-2.3.0 [ x86_64 ]

  # => - current
  # =* - current && default
  #  * - default

</pre>


To switch to a different version of Ruby, type `rvm use VERSION`

For instance: `rvm use 1.9.2`

Type `ruby -v` to see that it has changed.

Now all gems will be installed for this version of Ruby.

If you want to switch back to the System Ruby type: `rvm system`.
