When you push an app, Cloud Foundry determines which buildpack to use by running each enabled buildpacks' detect script during [staging](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/how-applications-are-staged.html). 

During staging, each buildpack has a position in a priority list (identified by running `cf buildpacks`). Cloud Foundry checks if the buildpack in position 1 is a compatible buildpack. If the position 1 buildpack is not compatible, Cloud Foundry moves on to the buildpack in position 2. Cloud Foundry continues this process until the correct buildpack is found. If no buildpack is compatible  `cf push` fails with the error:

```
None of the buildpacks detected a compatible application
Exit status 222
Staging failed: Exited with status 222

FAILED
NoAppDetectedError
```
